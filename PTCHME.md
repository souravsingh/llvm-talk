#### What's Numba?

- Numba is Python package for running Python and NumPy code faster.

---

#### How does it do the job?

- It uses LLVM to generate intermediate code which can be compiled and optimized.
- Ability to leverage GPU computation through CUDA.

#### Why Numba? I already use X Compiler for Python

- Has a learning curve
- Requires retooling a project, which can cost development time.
