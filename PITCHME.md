#### What's Numba?

- Numba is Python package for running Python and NumPy code faster.


---

#### How does it do the job?

- It uses LLVM to generate intermediate code which can be compiled and optimized.
- Ability to leverage GPU computation through CUDA and NVVM.

----

#### Why Numba? I already use X Compiler for Python

- Has a learning curve
- Requires retooling a project, which can cost development time.
- Certain libraries don't work with certain Python compilers (like Scipy for PyPy compilers)

#### Use of Numba

- Scientific applications
- High-performance computing
